The wires that connect us stretch for thousands of miles. They traverse oceans. They give us the possibility to interact within seconds or less.

So are we close by or far away?

We are interested in making the distances tangible. We want to do this in a two step project.

First, we are working on getting thedistancefromyoutous.com live. Through the Google Maps API we find out where the user is located. We then measure the distance from them to us. This results is a website the length of the distance. So if you are in Tokyo and we are in Amsterdam, the website will be 9289 kilometers long. Below you will find a first sketch of the design, which we intent to keep minimal, as we don't want to clutter the concept.

Second, we want to translate the pixels back into a physical form in an installation. How we will set about this, we are not completely sure yet. We will elaborate this in future posts.

Next post will go into the technical side of the website.
